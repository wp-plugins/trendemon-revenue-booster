Since TrenDemon is loaded asynchronously (only after your site has finished loading), it will not slow down your site. 

= Which languages does TrenDemon support? =

= What layouts are available? = 
Checkout our Features sections on the TrenDemon website (trendemon.com) to see the available units and their behavior.

= Why don't I see any unit after installing TrenDemon? = 
TrenDemon’s content recommendations units may need 1-2 hours to scan your site and find related articles for your visitors. 
 
= How  do I control which units are shown? = 
In the Settings area you can enable or disable the various units.

= What are goals? = 
Goals are events, actions or destinations on your site you want your visitors to reach. Some examples of conversions:
* Signing up to a newsletter
* Submitting a lead form
* Starting  a Product Trial
* Viewing X number of pages
 
You can define other custom conversion goals as well (contact our support to learn how).
  
= How do I define a conversion goal? = 
To setup a conversion goal, go to Conversions > Add New. Define the URL you want the users to reach. If the TrenDemon code is not present on that page, you can embed a conversion tracking pixel to allow TrenDemon to track and optimize this conversion.

If enabled, your visitors can share content and see how many people they've reached with their share. They can get rewarded based on their performance using weekly or monthly giveaways.
 
 = How do I activate the PLAY functionality? = 
Since the PLAY activity requires a higher level of engagement and interaction with the audience (giveaways, rewards, messages, etc.) we recommend that only advanced users that have the ability to interact and reward their audience members activate this feature.
